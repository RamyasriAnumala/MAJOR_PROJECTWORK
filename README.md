The Smart Industrial Gas Leakage Detection System is an IoT-based safety project designed to monitor and detect harmful gas leaks in industrial environments. Using gas sensors such as MQ-series modules, the system continuously measures gas concentration levels and triggers an alert when leakage is detected. When the gas level crosses the safety threshold, the system automatically activates alarms, sends notifications, and can even control safety devices like exhaust fans or shutoff valves. This smart system helps prevent accidents, ensures worker safety, and provides real-time monitoring, making it ideal for factories, chemical plants, and industrial safety management.
